# Stock Contender 

Stock Contender is a sophisticated stock advising application designed to identify potential investment opportunities using an array of libraries and algorithms. It analyzes various factors to filter the top 15 stocks from each search, subsequently breaking them down to the top 3, and provides users with clear, concise, and data-backed decisions on stock investments.

## Features üéâ

- Data-driven stock selection algorithm
- Top 15 stock filtering from each search
- Comprehensive breakdown to the top 3 stocks
- Robust ranking backed by comprehensive data
- Integration with OpenAI GPT for additional insights and filtering

## Prerequisites üìö

To utilize Stock Contender, you must have an OpenAI API Key. This key is essential as the application integrates with the OpenAI GPT model to filter and rank stocks.

### How to Get Your OpenAI API Key

>[Create your OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) by registering a free account. Please be aware, the API key is displayed just once, so **ensure you save your API key to a local text file for future usage.** If misplaced, a new one will need to be generated.

## Setup and Installation üõ†Ô∏è

Installing Stock Contender is as simple as executing the application file after the download. Upon running the executable, the application will automatically download the necessary libraries required for its operation - these can be found in the `requirements.txt` file within the installation directory. Should the application prompt for permissions, please accept to proceed. This may take several minutes if it's the first time running the application.

## Usage üíª

After launching the Stock Contender application, you'll be prompted to enter your API key. If you need guidance on how to obtain this key, please refer to the 'How to Get Your OpenAI API Key' section.

Enter your API key by typing it directly into the designated input area, or paste it if you have it copied. Click the 'Activate' button to submit your key. The application will verify your key - if it is accepted, you will be notified. In case of any issues with the key, an error message will be displayed indicating the problem.

With your API key validated, you're ready to begin. Click on the available option to start the analysis process. Stock Contender will then commence its robust data collection and analysis to identify the most promising stocks for investment. 

As the application works its magic, a progress bar will illustrate the ongoing process of data collection and analysis. Upon reaching 100%, the advised stocks will be displayed on the right side of the application. 

Once you have reviewed the output, you can reset the application by clicking the 'Reset and Clear' button. Feel free to repeat the process by clicking on the available option button again for new results. Remember, each analysis by the data-driven AI may yield different stocks - but rest assured, each of them is a solid contender.
