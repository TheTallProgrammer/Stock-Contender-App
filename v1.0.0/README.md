# Stock Contender v1.0.0 

Welcome to the first release of Stock Contender, your sophisticated, AI-powered stock advisory tool. Stock Contender is a state-of-the-art, data-driven stock advising application, leveraging the power of advanced algorithms and the Chat GPT AI model by OpenAI. It deploys sophisticated data screening techniques to provide optimized, accurate, and profitable investment opportunities in the current stock market.

## Current Features ðŸŽ‰

- **AI-Driven Stock Selection:** The application filters real-time stock data using intricate algorithms and OpenAI's GPT model to identify and suggest the top 3 contender stocks. These selections are the stocks deemed most worthy to compete in the current market, based on comprehensive data analysis and AI-driven decision-making processes.

- **Optimized Data Collection:** Stock Contender has been designed to provide quick, real-time results. It identifies specific data critical to investment decisions and delivers accurate outcomes in record time. 

- **Stylish and User-Friendly Interface:** With a simplistic and eye-friendly style sheet theme, Stock Contender makes stock selection a breeze. Its user-friendly design allows for seamless navigation and operation.

- **Reset and Clear Feature:** Stock Contender is equipped with a 'Reset and Clear' function that enables users to clear the current results and rerun the program to their heart's content. This feature allows users to get fresh analysis and recommendations whenever they want.

- **Dynamic Output:** Every run of the application produces different outputs, offering users a variety of options while maintaining accuracy in the best stocks to choose from. Repeated stocks in multiple outputs are strong indicators of profitable investment opportunities.

- **Real-Time Screener Data and News Analysis:** Stock Contender bases its recommendations on real-time screener data and a wide range of news, including analytic reviews, company meetings, and financials. The algorithm considers all these factors to ensure accurate and profitable recommendations.

## Future Features ðŸš€

I have ambitious plans for Stock Contender. With your support and feedback, I aim to make it the go-to application for stock advising. Here's a sneak peek into what's in store:

- **Secure User Authentication:** I understand the importance of security and convenience. In an upcoming update, I plan to introduce a login screen that will store user credentials securely in a remote SQL database. This feature will also offer users the option to save their API keys with their credentials for easy access.

- **Expanding User Options:** I'm working on expanding the functionalities available to users. Future updates will offer at least four additional options for contending stocks. These include:

  - **Individual Stock Analysis:** Users will be able to input specific stocks for detailed analysis, providing precise feedback on the investment potential of the selected stocks.
  
  - **Stock Comparer:** Analyze and compare different stocks to understand their performance, growth, and potential.
  
  - **Revolutionary Stock Price Prediction:** I am currently in the process of developing advanced algorithms that will forecast stock price movements based on a plethora of data. This feature is currently a work in progress, and I aim to revolutionize stock prediction with it.
  
  - **Stock of the Day:** A new feature that presents you with the top stock pick of the day, backed by extensive data analysis. This feature will be more data-driven and accurate than the current top 3 stocks due to a significantly larger room for token count.

Stay tuned for these exciting enhancements that will transform your stock advising experience with Stock Contender!
