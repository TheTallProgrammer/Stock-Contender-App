# Stock Contender v1.0

Stock Contender is a state-of-the-art, data-driven stock advising application, leveraging the power of advanced algorithms and the Chat GPT AI model by OpenAI. It deploys sophisticated data screening techniques to provide optimized, accurate, and profitable investment opportunities in the current stock market.

## Current Features üéâ

- **AI-Driven Stock Selection:** The application filters real-time stock data using intricate algorithms and OpenAI's GPT model to identify and suggest the top 3 contender stocks. These selections are the stocks deemed most worthy to compete in the current market, based on comprehensive data analysis and AI-driven decision-making processes.

- **Optimized Data Collection:** Stock Contender has been designed to provide quick, real-time results. It identifies specific data critical to investment decisions and delivers accurate outcomes in record time. 

- **Stylish and User-Friendly Interface:** With a simplistic and eye-friendly style sheet theme, Stock Contender makes stock selection a breeze. Its user-friendly design allows for seamless navigation and operation.

- **Reset and Clear Feature:** Stock Contender is equipped with a 'Reset and Clear' function that enables users to clear the current results and rerun the program to their heart's content. This feature allows users to get fresh analysis and recommendations whenever they want.

- **Dynamic Output:** Every run of the application produces different outputs, offering users a variety of options while maintaining accuracy in the best stocks to choose from. Repeated stocks in multiple outputs are strong indicators of profitable investment opportunities.

- **Real-Time Screener Data and News Analysis:** Stock Contender bases its recommendations on real-time screener data and a wide range of news, including analytic reviews, company meetings, and financials. The algorithm considers all these factors to ensure accurate and profitable recommendations.

## Prerequisites üìö

Stock Contender requires an OpenAI API Key for operation. This key is crucial as the application integrates with OpenAI's GPT model for stock filtering and ranking. 

### How to Get Your OpenAI API Key

>[Create your OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) by registering a free account. Please be aware, the API key is displayed just once, so **ensure you save your API key to a local text file for future usage.** If misplaced, a new one will need to be generated.

## Setup and Installation üõ†Ô∏è

Installing Stock Contender is as simple as executing the application file after the download. Upon running the executable, the application will automatically download the necessary libraries required for its operation - these can be found in the `requirements.txt` file within the installation directory. Should the application prompt for permissions, please accept to proceed. This may take several minutes if it's the first time running the application.

## Usage üíª

After launching the Stock Contender application, you'll be prompted to enter your API key. If you need guidance on how to obtain this key, please refer to the 'How to Get Your OpenAI API Key' section.

Enter your API key by typing it directly into the designated input area, or paste it if you have it copied. Click the 'Activate' button to submit your key. The application will verify your key - if it is accepted, you will be notified. In case of any issues with the key, an error message will be displayed indicating the problem.

With your API key validated, you're ready to begin. Click on the available option to start the analysis process. Stock Contender will then commence its robust data collection and analysis to identify the most promising stocks for investment. 

As the application works its magic, a progress bar will illustrate the ongoing process of data collection and analysis. Upon reaching 100%, the advised stocks will be displayed on the right side of the application. 

Once you have reviewed the output, you can reset the application by clicking the 'Reset and Clear' button. Feel free to repeat the process by clicking on the available option button again for new results. Remember, each analysis by the data-driven AI may yield different stocks - but rest assured, each of them is a solid contender.

## Future Features üöÄ

I have ambitious plans for Stock Contender. With your support and feedback, I aim to make it the go-to application for stock advising. Here's a sneak peek into what's in store:

- **Secure User Authentication:** I understand the importance of security and convenience. In an upcoming update, I plan to introduce a login screen that will store user credentials securely in a remote SQL database. This feature will also offer users the option to save their API keys with their credentials for easy access.

- **Expanding User Options:** I'm working on expanding the functionalities available to users. Future updates will offer at least four additional options for contending stocks. These include:

  - **Individual Stock Analysis:** Users will be able to input specific stocks for detailed analysis, providing precise feedback on the investment potential of the selected stocks.
  
  - **Stock Comparer:** Analyze and compare different stocks to understand their performance, growth, and potential.
  
  - **Revolutionary Stock Price Prediction:** I am currently in the process of developing advanced algorithms that will forecast stock price movements based on a plethora of data. This feature is currently a work in progress, and I aim to revolutionize stock prediction with it.
  
  - **Stock of the Day:** A new feature that presents you with the top stock pick of the day, backed by extensive data analysis. This feature will be more data-driven and accurate than the current top 3 stocks due to a significantly larger room for token count.

Stay tuned for these exciting enhancements that will transform your stock advising experience with Stock Contender!
